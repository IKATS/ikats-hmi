**An overview of IKATS global architecture is available [here](https://github.com/IKATS/IKATS)**

This GUI, as web client, is carried out on a JavaScript basis, supported on the AngularJS Framework.
The version of JavaScript used is ES6, it is already more than 97% compatible with the main browsers (source: [ECMA Script compatibility table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)).
The consistency of the design and the "responsive" aspect is ensured by the CSS Bootstrap framework.

**IKATS HMI** is composed of :
* a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing users to interact with IKATS
* a vizualization module that embeds a library of viztools.


## IKATS GUI

Available features are:

1. Workflow management (New/Open/Save)
2. Data management:
   2.1 Datasets (delete/deep delete)
   2.2 tables (delete)
3. Operators list (with a search box
4. Worflow area (on which operators can be slided from operators list, and linked together to build a workflow)

## IKATS Vizualization module

This module allows you to display generically data generated by an IKATS operator (computed or explored data).
It is composed of 2 sub-modules : _VizTools_ and _VizEngine_

The sub-module VizTools is a kind of Factory. It dynamically instantiates instances of VizTool ("data visualization tool / models").
The central point of this module is therefore the sub-module "VizEngine" (i.e: rendering engine), it then has a coordinator role between the different "instances" of the sub-module VizTools.
This architectural choice allows great flexibility in adding, modifying or deleting a visualization tool.
